Single member districts drawn by politicians do not promote equal representation in the legislature. They encourage politicians to draw districts in such a way as to solidify their hold on power without regard to majoritarian support. Political parties have evolved as a means for people to organize around shared values and agendas, and we should embrace this aspect of parties. Geographical concerns remain relevant to communities, and so we should also strive to give voice to those local concerns that are separate from partisan opinion.

Several countries have established representative bodies that embrace both partisan and geographic representation via a system known as [Mixed Member Proportional Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation) in which a portion of a body's members are elected to represent traditional geographical single-member districts, and the rest are chosen by allocating a number of seats to each party, based on the proportion of votes received by that party, and each party chooses members to fill those seats.

> Parliament shall consist of elected representatives in a mixed member proportional system. The number of members elected to represent geographic districts shall be equal to the number of representatives elected by party list.
> 
> No person elected to represent a district may also fill a party list seat.

## Districts

Districts should be as compact as possible, while respecting the geography of existing communities. To respect the principle of one person, one vote, districts should have an equally sized populations (or as close to equal as practical). And districts should be small enough that their representatives can adequately represent the diversity of their constituents, yet not so numerous as to make their assembly impractical. And in order to determine their size, they must be measured periodically.

> Parliament shall commission a census of the resident population every eight years, in the year prior to the expiration of the term of Parliament.

> Parliament itself shall be responsible for determining the number of districts and their boundaries, following each census, but no district shall have fewer than one hundred thousand residents not more than two hundred and fifty thousand residents as of the most recent census.
> 
> District boundaries must be continuous and contiguous. District boundaries should be compact and respect existing community boundaries, where possible. However, the ratio of the population of the largest district to the population of the smallest district may be no larger than 1.05.
> 
> In the event of a vacancy in the representation of a district, due to resignation, removal, death or other incapacity, the President of the Senate shall call a special election in the district within forty five days of the vacancy, and the winner shall be seated immediately upon certification of the election by the Senate.

## Parties

Parties organize around not just policy preferences, but also around policy priorities. So while two parties may share the same positions on different issues, they may differ on the relative importance of acting on those positions, especially when the art of legislating often means compromise and deal making. These differences can lead to a proliferation of small parties, which, while making representation of the true spectrum of partisan preference possible, also makes governance through coalition building unstable. So we should limit the number of parties in government to a sensible size that balances these needs.

Therefore:

> Any party which receives at least three percent of the national vote is entitled to at least one seat in Parliament. Any party which receives less than three percent of the national vote and does not win any district election is not entitled to any party list seats.

While parties generally represent a collection of people with shared political philosophies and policy positions, the reality is that rarely do individuals agree with every policy choice of any any party, including the leaders of those parties. So when it comes time to choose partisan representation in Parliament, we are actually choosing individuals who may at times diverge in their opinions from the party platform, and so those particular individuals must be named if voters are to discern what a vote for a given party will actually mean in terms of how their vote reflects their policy preferences.

Therefore:

> 30 days prior to an election, each party qualified for the ballot must publish the list of members, in order, that it will appoint to Parliament based on its allocation of seats.

With an integral number of seats, and no fractional representation, we must devise a method for dividing party list seats in a manner such that the integral number of seats allocated to each party is a as close as possible to the share of the vote that each party receives. We find that the [method of equal proportions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%E2%80%93Hill_method) arrives at the fairest allocation of seats.

> Party seats shall be allocated using the method of equal proportions. Initially, each party will be allocated the number of seats won in district elections. Then any party with no district-based seats that received at least three percent of the party vote shall be allocated one seat. The remaining seats shall be allocated one at a time to the party with the highest priority, with priority defined as the ratio of the number of votes the party received to the geometric mean of of the number of seats the party is currently assigned and the number of seats the party would be assigned if the next seat were allocated to the party. Mathematically, this can be expressed as
> 
>     P = V / ((n * (n + 1)) ^  (1/2))
> 
> Where `P` is the party's priority, `V` is the number of votes received by the party, and `n` is the number of seats currently allocated to the party.

Parties are always evolving, and we should strive to ensure that as the preferences of the electorate evolve, the ability of new parties to access the ballot should not impede their formation. On the other hand, we should strive to preserve some stability in our parties, such that voters can be confident in their choices. So parties that are currently represented in the Parliament should always have access to the ballot, and new parties should have a means of gaining ballot access when they have demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of winning seats in Parliament when granted ballot access.

Therefore:

> Any party currently represented in Parliament is automatically qualified for the ballot. A party may also qualify for the ballot by submitting petitions signed by one half of one percent of the number of votes cast in the prior election, or upon the sponsorship of five members of the Senate.

> In the event of a vacancy in the representation of a party, due to resignation, removal, death or other incapacity, the vacancy shall remain unfilled until the next general election.

## Term

In order to most faithfully represent the evolving opinions of the electorate, the term of Parliament should not be too long. Nor should its term be so short as to cause instability or prevent the government from enacting its agenda. Four year terms give the government an adequate amount of time to settle in, enact an agenda and demonstrate the success (or failure) of its policies.

Therefore:

> Elections for Parliament shall be concluded on the first day of June in years divisible by four, and newly elected members shall take office at noon on the first day of July.

However, there are times when the actions of the government cause the electorate to lose confidence in the government well before the expiration of its term.  So there needs to be a safety valve that allows the electorate to urgently replace a defiant or corrupt government. We grant the Senate the authority to dissolve Parliament and call early elections in such an emergency.

> The Senate, with the consent of three fifths of its membership, may dissolve Parliament and call early elections to fill the remainder of the current Parliament's term, so long as there remain six months in the term of the current Parliament. In this case, an election must be concluded within forty five days of the Senate dissolving Parliament, and newly elected members shall take office at noon, fifteen days following the conclusion of the election.

From time to time, there arise disputes as to the vote counts or proper winner of an election. As the Parliament has a conflict of interest in adjudicating these disputes, the power to settle such disputes should be left to an independent body. And as the judiciary can potentially be captured by partisan actors, this role must be left to the Senate to ensure free and fair elections.

Therefore:

> The Senate shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of the members of Parliament.

## Qualifications

In order to be effective as legislators, we expect a certain degree of experience and understanding of policy for members of Parliament.

> No person may serve in Parliament who has not reached the age of 25 years.

> No person may serve in Parliament who has been convicted of a felony.

> No person may serve in Parliament while simultaneously serving in the armed forces.
