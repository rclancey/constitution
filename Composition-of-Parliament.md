Legislative power is vested solely in the Parliament. While Parliament may delegate to executive agencies the power to promulgate the technical rules and minutae necessary to carry out Parliament's legislative vision. Parliament, and Parliament alone is responsible for drafting and enacting public policy.

A simple majority in Parliament is required to pass legislation. The Senate can veto bills passed by Parliament with a two thirds vote, but Parliament may override such a veto with a two thirds vote of its own.

Executive power is similarly vested in Parliament. However, Parliament may delegate, as it sees fit, some or all of its executive authority to executive ministers such as the prime minister or various cabinet ministers, or to independent bodies. In all such cases, this delegation of executive authority must be made via legislation, and Parliament shall always retain the power to rescind or modify such delegations of its executive power through passage of overriding legislation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _**The legislative power shall be vested in a Parliament.**_
>
> _**Parliament may enact legislation with a majority of its membership in favor. However, should two thirds of the Senate object to an Act of Parliament, the Act shall be returned to Parliament for reconsideration, and require the vote of two thirds of its membership to become law.**_

> Parliament may delegate to executive agencies the power to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out Parliament's legislative vision. No Act of Parliament shall be construed to grant an executive agency authority over Parliament. Any rule or regulation promulgated by an executive agency is subject to review by Parliament, and may be overruled by a majority of its membership.

As with all legislative bodies, Parliament is comprised of single member districts, and party list representatives, in a mixed member proportional system. Parliament is responsible for determining the total number of district representatives, with the limitation that no district may contain more than 500,000 residents, nor fewer than 250,000. The total number of party list seats will always be equal to the number of district seats.

> _**As a legislative body, Parliament shall consist of an equal number of representatives elected by geographical districs and representatives elected by party list.**_

> Parliament shall determine the number of districts, and their boundaries, with the additional restriction that districts may not contain more than 500,000 residents, nor fewer than 250,000 residents. As with all legislative bodies, district boundaries must be continuous and contiguous, compact, and respect existing community boundaries where possible, while restricting the ratio of the population of the largest district to the population of the smallest district to no larger than 1.05.

In order to ensure that districts adhere to these size requirements, Parliament needs to regularly conduct a census before drawing districts. Full census counts can be costly and time consuming, and ideally, districts should be somewhat stable to keep residents connected to their representatives, so we shouldn't conduct them during every term of Parliament. With a term of four years, even conducting a census every other term seems burdensome, and a decennial census would put every other census halfway through a Parliamentary term, so let's use a twelve year census period. The census should ideally be concluded far enough in advance of the next general election that Parliament has time to draw new districts, and for candidates to meet their potential constituents.

> Parliament shall commission a census of the population during every third term. Such a census shall not be initiated more than two years prior to the expiration of its term, nor completed less than one year prior to the end of its term.

## Term

In order to most faithfully represent the evolving opinions of the electorate, the term of Parliament should not be too long. Nor should its term be so short as to cause instability or prevent the government from enacting its agenda. Four year terms give the government an adequate amount of time to settle in, enact an agenda and demonstrate the success (or failure) of its policies.

Therefore:

> The term of Parliament shall end at noon (in the local time zone of the capital) on the first day of years divisible by four. Elections for members of Parliament shall conclude 30 days prior to the expiration of the term of the current Parliament, at which time, Parliament shall be dissolved. Newly elected members shall assume office immediately following the expiration of the term of the previous Parliament.

However, there are times when the actions of the government cause the electorate to lose confidence in the government well before the expiration of its term.  So there needs to be a safety valve that allows the electorate to urgently replace a defiant or corrupt government. We grant the Senate the authority to dissolve Parliament and call early elections in such an emergency.

> The Senate, with the consent of three fifths of its membership, may dissolve Parliament and call early elections to fill the remainder of the current Parliament's term, provided the current Parliament has been in office for one year, and there remain at least 180 days in the term of the current Parliament. In this case, an election must be concluded within forty five days of the Senate dissolving Parliament, and newly elected members shall be assume office at noon, fifteen days following the conclusion of the election.

Vacancies frequently arise during the course of a Parliamentary term, whether due to a member's death, incapacity, resignation, expulsion or disqualification. In those instances where a member represents a district, such a vacancy would be deleterious to the interests of that district, and so the vacancy should be filled at the earliest possible opportunity.

Therefore:

> When a vacancy arises in a Parliamentary seat that represents a distict more than 120 days prior to the end of a Parliamentary term, the Prime Minister shall call for an election in the district in question, which shall conclude no later than 45 days following the vacancy. The newly elected member shall assume office immediately upon certification of the election. For purposes of vote thresholes, such vacancies shall reduce the membership of Parliament until a new member is seated.
> 
> Should a vacancy arise in a party list Parliamentary seat, the seat shall remain vacant until the next Parliament is chosen. For purposes of vote thresholds, such vacancies shall reduce the membership of Parliament.

From time to time, there arise disputes as to the vote counts or proper winner of an election. As the Parliament has a conflict of interest in adjudicating these disputes, the power to settle such disputes should be left to an independent body. And as the judiciary can potentially be captured by partisan actors, this role must be left to the Senate to ensure free and fair elections.

Therefore:

> The Senate shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of the members of Parliament.

At times, Parliament may need to expel members for offenses ranging from criminal behavior, ethical failures, chronic absence, or incompetence. By a majority vote, Parliament may recommend a member for expulsion. The Senate can then remove the member with a two thirds vote.

> Parliament may, by majority vote, refer a member to the Senate for expulsion. If two thirds of Senators concur, the member shall be expelled from Parliament.

## Disolved Parliament

Parliament may be disolved early by the Senate, or at the end of its term following an election. A disolved Parliament may continue in its duties, but its actions should not bind a future Parliament, so its acts should automatically expire. To give the next Parliament the opportunity to review acts of a disolved Parliament, the acts of a disolved Parliament should remain in effect for a short period in the new Parliament. A new Parliament may repeal, ratify or allow to expire any acts of a previously disolved Parliament. Judges and any executive agency personel who may normally be appointed to a term independent of the term of Parliament may only be appointed on a temporary basis under a disolved Parliament.

> No act of a disolved Parliament, including the appointment of judges and executive agency personel, may be in force for more than one year after the dissolution of Parliament. A future Parliament may repeal any Act of a disolved Parliament prior to its expiration, or ratify such an Act, allowing it to remain in force, or simply allow it to expire. Simliarly, Parliament may revoke the commission of any judge or executive agency personel appointed by a disolved Parliament prior to the expiration of such commission, or ratify such a commission, extending its term to the regular term as of its initial grant.

## Qualifications

In order to be effective as legislators, we expect a certain degree of experience and understanding of policy for members of Parliament.

> No person may serve in Parliament who has not reached the age of 25 years.

> No person may serve in Parliament who has been convicted of a felony.

> No person may serve in Parliament who has previoiusly held any office of trust under a foreign government.

> No person may serve in Parliament while simultaneously serving in the armed forces.

> No person may serve in Parliament while simultaneously serving in another legislative body.

> No person may serve in Parliament while simultaneously serving as a judge on any court.

## Organization

The first order of business for a newly seated Parliament is to organize itself, and the first order of business is to select a presiding officer or speaker. Until such an officer is elected, the President of the Senate will temporarily fill the role, for the sole purpose of electing a speaker. The speaker should not be a partisan position, his or her responsibility is to the rules of the Parliament, not the policy preferences of the government. The presiding officer shall take public nominations from the membership, which must be seconded, of any other member to be speaker, followed by a public ranked choice vote by the full membership, the winner of which shall immediately assume the office of speaker. 

> Upon the first meeting of a newly elected Parliament, the President of the Senate shall preside over the election of Parliament's Speaker. The President shall call for public nominations from the members of Parliament, subject to affirmation from a second member, of any other member to stand for election as their Speaker. Once the President has determined that no further nominations are forthcoming, the full membership of Parliament shall cast public ranked choice votes to elect the Speaker, in the same manner that is used for all single winner offices. Upon election, the Speaker shall preside over all further proceedings of Parliament.
> 
> The Speaker shall appoint three deputies in priority order, who shall preside over Parliament in an acting capacity in cases of the Speaker's absence. Should the Speakership become permanently vacant, a new Speaker shall be elected, with the acting Speaker presiding over such an election.
> 
> The Speaker shall be the arbiter of Parliament's rules. At the objection of the Prime Minister to a ruling from the Speaker, a majority of the membership may overrule or depose the Speaker.

Following the election of the speaker, Parliament should elect a Prime Minister (the head of government), and a leader of the opposition. These officers are elected via instant runoff voting with a single ballot. Each party's leader in Parliament is nominated to be Prime Minister. The membership then casts public ranked choice votes, where their first choice must be the leader of their own party. The winner of this vote becomes Prime Minister. The election is rerun from the beginning, using the same ballots, excluding any ballot ultimately cast for the Prime Minister. The winner of this second round becomes the Leader of the Opposition.

> Parliament shall elect a Prime Minister and a Leader of the Opposition using a single ranked choice election. The leader of each party's delegation in Parliament shall be nominated to the office of Prime Minister. The membership shall cast public ranked choice votes for Prime Minister, and the winner of this election shall immediately assume the office of Prime Minister. Then the same ballots shall be recounted, excluding those ultimately cast for the Prime Minister, and the winner of this second count shall immediately assume the office of Leader of the Opposition.
> 
> The Prime Minister shall appoint a deputy, who shall temporarily assume the responsibilities of the Prime Minister if he or she is unable to perform them due to absence or infirmity. In the event of the death, resignation, removal, or permanent incapacity of the Prime Minister, the deputy shall carry out the responsiblities of the Prime Minister until such time as the Parliament shall elect a new Prime Minister.
> 
> The Leader of the Opposition shall appoint a deputy, who shall temporarily assume the responsibilities of the Leader of the Opposition if her or she is unable to perform them due to absence or infirmity. In the event of the death, resignation, removal, or permanent incapacity of the Leader of the Opposition, the deputy shall assume the office of Leader of the Opposition, and appoint a new deputy.
> 
> Parliament may enact a statutory order of succession for both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for cases when both the primary officer and deputy are unable to perform the duties of their office.

Parliament should have the option to remove leaders who are unfaithful, incompentent or corrupt, short of disolving Parliament. To this end, the Speaker may call for a vote of confidence, in which the members may oust the Prime Minister (from the office of Prime Minister, not from Parliament).

> At any time the Speaker judges that the Prime Minister no longer holds the support of a majority of the membership, he or she may call for a vote of confidence. If a majority of the membership opposes the Prime Minister, the Speaker shall hold a new election for Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition.

After electing a speaker and Prime Minister, Parliament should adopt rules for its proceedings. As the Parliament is not a continuing body, the rules of Parliamentary procedure from one Parliament may not be imposed on future Parliaments without their consent. These rules cover the ways Parliament conducts itself, but may not purport to require higher or lower thresholds for the enactment of legislation or other Parliamentary duties that are set forth in this Constitution.

> At the opening of Parliament, the Speaker shall offer for the consideration of Parliament a set or Rules of Parliamentary Procedure for the remainder of the sitting of Parliament. Any Rules of Parliamentary Procedure may be adopted by a majority of the membership. Under no circumstance may the Rules of Parliamentary Procedure purport to alter the thresholds for Acts of Parliament set forth in this Constitution.

### Legislative Committees

The legislative business of the Parliament is allocated among several committees. Committees are be established by the Rules of Parliamentary Procedure adopted at the opening of Parliament. These rules should establish the policy purview of each committee (which may be overlapping). When a member of Parliament offers legislation for consideration, the Speaker directs the committees with relevant jurisdiction to consider the bill. A committee may amend the bill and report it back to the speaker with any additional amendments to be considered by the whole Parliament. Any bill reported back to the speaker from a committee must be put to a vote (along with its proposed amendments) before the full Parliament within a reasonable amount of time.

The membership of each committee is determined by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, with the Prime Minister appointing the majority of the members, and the members of the committee electing their own chair.

> The Rules of Parliamentary Procedure shall establish legislative committees and the policy domains over which each shall have jurisdiction.
> 
> Upon the offering of a bill by a member of Parliament, the Speaker shall direct each committee with jurisdiction over its subject matter to consider the bill. A committee considering a bill may amend it and report it back to the Speaker with additional proposed amendments, or the committee may reject the bill. If multiple committees report back different versions of the bill, the Speaker shall direct the committees to agree on a single version of the bill and proposed amendments. When a bill has been reported back to the Speaker by any committee, the bill and committee proposed amendments must be presented to the whole of Parliament for consideration within a period defined by the Rules of Parliamentary Procedure.
> 
> Committees shall consist of an even multiple of nine members, with no fewer than 27. The Prime Minister shall appoint five ninths of the members to each legislative committee, and the Leader of the Opposition shall appoint the remainder. Each committee shall elect its own chair, who must receive the support of a majority of the committee's membership.
> 
> Should vacancies arise in committee membership in the middle of a Parliamentary term, the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition shall appoint replacements according to which officer appointed the departing member.

Legislative committees may divide their work amongst up to five subcommittees. The committee may establish such subcommittees without a formal act of Parliament. Subcommittees may have no more than nine members. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition shall each appoint half of the members of a subcommittee from amongst the committee's members, and the chair of the committee shall appoint the chair of the subcommittee from amongst the committee's members.

### Executive Ministries

The executive business of Parliament is performed by executive ministries. An executive ministry may be established by an act of Parliament. The executive officers of the executive ministries are appointed by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, form the cabinet and shadow cabinet.

> Parliament shall establish, through legislation, executive ministries and their subordinate agencies. The Prime Minister shall nominate an executive officer and two deputies to manage each ministry, and an executive officer to lead each subordinate agency. The Leader of the Opposition shall nominate an inspector general and one deputy to provide opposition oversight of each ministry. These nominees may not be Members of Parliament, and are subject to confirmation by the Senate. The executive officers of the ministries comprise the Prime Minister's cabinet, and the inspectors general comprise the Leader of the Opposition's shadow cabinet.

One particular weakness of democracies is that elected governments with the authority to conduct elections can tilt the playing field to their own advantage, which can allow them to remain in power without true majority support. For this reason, we should empower the opposition to govern elections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The executive ministry charged with overseeing elections shall be controlled by the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition shall nominate an executive officer and two deputies to manage this ministry, and an executive officer to lead each of its subordinate agencies. The Prime Minister shall nominate an inspector general and one deputy to provide executive oversight of the ministry. As with other executive ministries, these nominees may not be Members of Parliament, and are subject to confirmation by the Senate.
