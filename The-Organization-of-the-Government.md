Since Parliament is not a continuing body, at the expiration of the term of Parliament, the body has no members, and no officers, and so cannot be self-organizing.  So the task of accepting election returns and swearing in members is left to the Senate, which is a continuing body, in particular, the President of the Senate. After the new membership of Parliament is sworn into office, the President of the Senate conducts an election for the Speaker of Parliament, whose role is to manage Parliamentary procedure. Each party represented in Parliament may nominate one of its members for the office of Speaker, and the election proceeds as a series of run offs, where the candidate receiving the fewest votes is eliminated and his or her voters choose one of the remaining candidates, until one candidate receives the votes of a majority of the membership. (This process is similar to the instant runoff method used in district elections, though it differs in that members are not required to state their entire preference order in advance.) Once chosen, the Speaker is responsible for conducting an election for Prime Minister and Opposition Leader. The election of the Prime Minister is to be conducted in the same manner as for the Speaker, though the nominees of each party may be different. The election of the Opposition Leader is conducted in the same manner as the election of the Prime Minister, with the same nominees, but only those members who did not vote for the Prime Minister in the final round may participate.

> At the opening of Parliament, the President of the Senate shall act as Speaker Pro Tempore, and shall swear in the new membership. Once all election disputes have been resolved, and all members seated, he or she shall conduct an election for the Speaker of Parliament, who must be chosen by a majority of the membership.

## The Speaker

The Speaker is responsible for proposing the rules of parliamentary procedure to be used for the term of Parliament, enforcing those rules, and managing the legislative business of Parliament, such as scheduling and conducting votes on legislation and nominations, moderating floor debate, and ruling legislative amendments in or out of order.

> The Speaker shall then offer a resolution to adopt the rules of procedure for the duration of the term of Parliament, and the Senate President shall request the assent of a majority of the membership. If the resolution fails, the Senate President may hold a new election for Speaker or ask the Speaker to offer an amended resolution, until one is adopted by a majority of the membership.
> 
> Once the rules of procedure are adopted, the Speaker shall become the presiding officer of Parliament. He or she shall impartially enforce the rules of procedure; moderate and maintain order during floor debate; rule on whether legislative amendments are in or out of order; schedule and conduct floor votes on legislation (including amendments) and nominations.

## The Prime Minister

The Prime Minister is the head of government. He or she is responsible for the faithful execution of the law, appointing the principal officers of the executive ministries, appointing the majority of the members of legislative and oversight committees, nominating judges to the Supreme Court, and commanding the military during wartime. The Prime Minister is chosen by a majority of the members of Parliament, and directs the governing coalition's legislative agenda.

### The Leader of the Opposition

The Leader of the Opposition may be thought of as the Prime Minister in waiting. He or she leads the partisan coalition that stands in opposition to the Prime Minister's legislative agenda, and is responsible for appointing the inspectors general of the executive ministries, and appointing a minority of the members of legislative and oversight committees.

> Upon the vacancy of the office of the Prime Minister or the office of the Leader of the Opposition (due to the opening of a new Parliament or the resignation, removal, death or other incapacitation of the former office holder), the Speaker shall conduct an election for the office of the Prime Minister, who must be chosen by a majority of the membership of Parliament; and the office of the Leader of the Opposition, who must be chosen by a majority of those voting in opposition to the Prime Minister.

## The Cabinet

The executive business of Parliament shall be performed by executive ministries. An executive ministry may be established by an act of Parliament. The principal officers of the executive ministries form the Cabinet. The inspectors general of the executive ministries form the Shadow Cabinet.

> Executive ministries shall be established by acts of Parliament, which shall define their purpose and organization.
> 
> The Prime Minister shall nominate an executive officer and two deputies for each executive ministry. Such nominations must be confirmed by a majority of the full membership of Parliament. An executive officer or deputy may be removed by the Prime Minister with the consent of Parliament. In the event of the resignation, removal, death or other incapacity of an executive officer, the first deputy shall assume the role of executive officer until such time as a permanent executive officer shall be nominated and confirmed.
> 
> The Leader of the Opposition shall appoint an inspector general and one deputy for each executive ministry. Such appointments are not subject to confirmation of Parliament. However, with the consent of three fifths of its membership, Parliament may remove an inspector general or deputy for dereliction of duty or abuse of office.
> 
> The principal officers and inspectors general of the executive ministries need not be members of Parliament. However, members of Parliament may server in these positions, in which case, they may not also serve on any legislative or oversight committee.

## Legislative Committees

Parliament needs to establish committees to draft and review legislation and to oversee the execution of the law. These committees should be given a charter that establishes their policy focus and the functions of the government over which they should exercise oversight. The majority should control the committees, but the opposition should have the opportunity to be heard. A reasonable division between them should allow for the majority to prevail in the face of one or two defections, but not silence the opposition. So we grant 15 seats to the majority, and 12 to the opposition.

Committee oversight of the government requires that committees have the power to compel testimony from the government. But we must also recognize the right against self incrimination. Committees have two options when requesting potentially self incriminating testimony: Parliament, at the recommendation of the committee, may grant immunity to the witness (either transactional immunity or use and derivative use immunity), or may simply prohibit the witness from serving in government while refusing testimony (though no such prohibition should extend beyond the term of Parliament).

> The legislative business of the Parliament shall be allocated among several committees. A committee may be established by an act of Parliament, which may also define the policy purview of the committee. A legislative committee may also be dissolved by an act of Parliament, which may also transfer its purview to other legislative committees.
> 
> The Prime Minister shall select fifteen members of each legislative committee, and the Leader of the Opposition shall select twelve members of each legislative committee. Each committee shall elect its own chair.
> 
> Legislative committees may divide their work amongst up to five subcommittees. The committee may establish such subcommittees without a formal act of Parliament. Subcommittees may have no more than nine members. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition shall each appoint half of the members of a subcommittee from amongst the committee's members, and the chair of the committee shall appoint the chair of the subcommittee from amongst the committee's members.
> 
> Any member of Parliament may propose a bill. The Speaker shall refer such a bill to one or more committees with purview over the topic of the bill. The committee may then amend the bill and report it back to the whole Parliament with any further proposed amendments. Any bill reported back to the whole Parliament by every committee to which it was referred shall be considered by the whole Parliament within ten legislative days.
> 
> Legislative committees may compel the appearance of witnesses to answer questions as to the operation of the executive ministries. No person may be compelled to provide testimony which may put the witness in jeopardy of criminal sanction. However, any person refusing to answer on this basis may be barred by the committee from serving in government until the witness provides the requested testimony or the Parliament expires or dissolves.
