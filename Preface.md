This document is more than a statement of the rules concerning how the government is to be constituted, and what its functions and limitations are. It is also meant to be a statement of the fundamental ideas about why the authors have chosen to design the government the way they have. The United States Constitution, which the authors have used as their inspiration, is elegant in its simplicity, but that simplicity has given rise to tortured legalistic arguments about its meaning devoid of the context of why its authors constructed it as they did. Our hope is that a richer text will help the citizenry, the government, and the legal profession, both present and future, to understand and interpret this document as it was intended, without having to invent baseless justifications for how to deal with novel circumstances the authors did not foresee.

As such, the majority of this document is written as simple prose, primarily concerned with reasoning behind each provision, as well as providing context around the meaning of each provision.

> Formal provisions are denoted in blocks such as this one.

However, these provisions should not be read in isolation, but in the context of the document as a whole, and in particular, in the context of the prose that surrounds them.

Some of the provisions in this document are foundational, and the authors believe that altering them would undermine the fundamental nature of the government constituted herein. These provisions are not to be amended, short of adopting an entirely new constitution.

> _**Foundational provisions are denoted in bold blocks**_

However, the authors of this constitution are not so confident in our own abilities to see the future as to foreclose on the possibility that some provisions of this constitution may prove unworkable, or that future circumstances will require changes or additions to this document. Indeed, it is the authors' intention that this constitution be a living document, that is frequently amended by future generations to suit the needs of the people, rather than a holy text that is perfect and unchanging.

Many of the structures envisioned in thie constitution are circularly dependent, meaning that the existence of one body depends on the existence of another, and that this second body depends on the existence of the first. For example, the legislature is elected through mechanisms the legistlature itself must define. For these sorts of situations, this document will define some initial conditions, through which the government may be brought into being, but these provisions cease to be operable once the government is fully constituted, and future legislation should not be bound by these provisions. These provisions will be included in a chapter marked "[Bootstrapping](./Bootstrapping)."
