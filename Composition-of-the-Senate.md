A bicameral legislature provides a useful check on government overreach. But in order to fulfill that function the two houses must be substantially different in their composition and function. We propose the creation of a Senate, composed of a randomly selected cross section of the populace, whose primary function is not crafting legislative language or deal making, but rather overseeing the work of the Parliament.

As we do not expect members of this body to begin with an expertise or even interest in governance, we should set the terms of these citizen legislators long enough for them to gain expertise, and stagger their terms so that the body as a whole can pass on institutional learnings to each class of Senators.

Therefore:

> The Senate shall be composed of one thousand residents, chosen for a term of eight years, with one fourth of their number chosen every two years, and their terms beginning the first day of January in odd numbered years.

Its members should be chosen much the same way that juries are selected. A random sampling of the population is gathered and then vetted by the government, the opposition, and the court. So that we may ensure that the Senate represents the full diversity of the citizenry, we place no qualification on Senators other than a minimum age and competence.

> Senators shall be chosen from a representative random sampling of eligible voters who have reached the age of eighteen years, are not currently incarcerated on account of a felony conviction, do not currently hold elective or judicial office, and who have not previously served in the Senate. Parliament shall enact a method for identifying such a sample, and summoning a pool of at least two thousand prospective Senators to the Capital for voir dire. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition may each dismiss up to five percent of prospective Senators for any reason. The Chief Justice shall then consider requests from prospective Senators to be excused under conditions established by Parliament. Of the remainder, any who are unanimously considered unfit to serve by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Chief Justice may be dismissed. Should the remaining pool number less than one thousand, this process shall be repeated. From this pool, two hundred shall be selected at random to serve in the Senate.

## The President of the Senate

The Senate should elect a President and Vice President (who assumes the Presidency in the event of the resignation, removal, death or other incapacity of the President). The President and Vice President should be members of the Senate, and should serve two year terms. However, the term of the President (and Vice President) should be staggered from the seating of a new class of Senators, to allow new Senators to become familiar with their colleagues.

> The Senate shall elect from amongst their number, a President who shall serve a single term of two years, beginning on the first day of January in even numbered years. The Senate shall also elect from amongst their number, a Vice President who shall assume the Presidency in the event of the resignation, removal, death or other incapacity of the President. A Senator who has less than two years remaining in his or her term as Senator may not be elected President or Vice President.

The role of the President is similar to the Speaker of Parliament. He or she is responsible for enforcing the rules of parliamentary procedure, managing the legislative business of the Senate, and moderating floor debate. The President also acts as the Speaker Pro Tempore of Parliament, responsible for conducting the election of the Speaker of Parliament (and adopting the rules for a new Parliament). The President also acts as the head of state.

> The President of the Senate shall impartially enforce the Senate's rules of procedure.

In the event that the Senate dissolves Parliament mid term, it is the responsibility of the President to schedule an early general election to elect a new Parliament.
