A bicameral legislature provides a useful check on government overreach. But in order to fulfill that function the two houses must be substantially different in their composition and function. We propose the creation of a Senate, composed of a randomly selected cross section of the populace, whose primary function is not crafting legislative language or deal making, but rather overseeing the work of the Parliament.

As we do not expect members of this body to begin with an expertise or even interest in governance, we should set the terms of these citizen legislators long enough for them to gain expertise, and stagger their terms so that the body as a whole can pass on institutional learnings to each class of Senators.

Therefore:

> The Senate shall be composed of one thousand residents, chosen for a term of eight years, with one fourth of their number chosen every two years, and their terms expiring at noon on the first day of January in odd numbered years.

Its members should be chosen much the same way that juries are selected. A random sampling of the population is gathered and then vetted by the government, the opposition, and the court. So that we may ensure that the Senate represents the full diversity of the citizenry, we place no qualification on Senators other than a minimum age and competence.

> Senators shall be chosen from a representative random sampling of eligible voters.  Parliament shall enact a method for identifying such a sample, and summoning a pool of at least two thousand prospective Senators to the Capital for voir dire no later than the first day of October in even numbered years. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition may each dismiss up to five percent of prospective Senators for any reason. The Chief Justice shall then consider petitions from prospective Senators to be excused under conditions established by Parliament. Of the remainder, any who are unanimously considered unfit to serve by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Chief Justice may be dismissed. Should the remaining pool number less than five hundred, this process shall be repeated to add to this pool, until a qualified pool of five hundred shall be assembled. From this pool, two hundred shall be selected at random to serve in the Senate.

## Qualifications

> * No person may be chosen as a member of the Senate who is not an eligible member of the electorate.
> * No person may be chosen as a member of the Senate who has not reached the age of eighteen years as of the first day of their term.
> * No person may be chosen as a member of the Senate who is currently incarcerated for a felony offense.
> * No person may be chosen as a member of the Senate while simultaneously holding elective or judicial office.
> * No person may be chosen as a member of the Senate while simultaneously serving in the armed forces.
> * No person may be chosen as a member of the Senate who has previoiusly held any office of trust under a foreign government.
> * No person may be chosen as a member of the Senate twice.

## Organization

The first order of business for a newly constituted Senate is to organize itself, and the first order og business is to select its President and Vice President. The role of the President is to preside over the proceedings of the Senate, and to act as Head of State. The role of the Vice President is to fulfill the duties of the President when the President is unable due to temporary absence of disability, and to assume the office of President in cases of death, resignation, removal or permanent disability of the President. As with all single winner offices, the President and Vice President are elected by independent ranked choice votes, over which the Speaker of Parliament presides.

> Upon the first meeting of a newly constituted Senate, the Speaker of Parliament shall preside over the election of the President. The Speaker shall call for public nominations from the members of the Senate, subject to affirmation from a second member, of any other member to stand for election as President. Once the Speaker has determined that no further nominations are forthcoming, the full Senate shall cast public ranked choice votes for President, in the same manner used for all single winner offices. Upon election, the President shall preside over all further procedings of the Senate, and serve as Head of State.
>
> The President shall then call for public nominations from the members of the Senate, subject to affirmation from a second member, of any other member to stand for election as Vice President. Once the President has determined that no further nominations are forthcoming, the full Senate shall cast public ranked choice votes for Vice President, in the same manner used for all single winner offices.
> 
> In the event that the President is temporarily unable to carry out the duties of the Presidency, due to absence or disability, the Vice President shall assume such duties. In the event of the death, resignation, removal or permanent disability of the President, the Vice President shall assume the office of President, and the Senate shall elect a new Vice President.
> 
> In the event of the death, resignation, removal or permanent disability of the Vice President, the Senate shall elect a new Vice President.

Following the elections of the President and Vice President, the Senate must adopt the rules governing its proceedings. As a continuing body, the Senate may simply vote to affirm its existing rules of procedure. However, as the membership of the Senate changes each term, the Senate may not be bound by the rules of a previous Senate without its consent. Should the Senate reject the existing rules, the Senate will debate and adopt new rules, during which any member may, with the affirmation of a second member, propose a single amendment to the rules, which may consist of changes to a specific rule or set of rules, the addition of one or more rules, or the wholesale replacement of the rules. Following the adoption of each amendment, the Senate may vote to adopt the amended rules, and continue on to its normal business.

> The Senate shall adopt its own Rules of Senate Procedure following the elections of the President and Vice President. In the event that the existing rules do not receive the support of a majority of the members, the President shall call for proposed amendments to the rules. Any Senator may offer, with the affirmation of a second Senator, a single amendment to the rules. Following the adoption of any amendment, the President may call for a vote to adopt the amended Rules. Should this vote receive less than majority support, the process of amending the rules shall continue.
>
> The President shall be the arbiter of the Senate's rules. At the objection of five members to a ruling from the President, a majority of the membership may overrule the President.

### The President of the Senate

The role of the President is similar to the Speaker of Parliament. He or she is responsible for enforcing the rules of parliamentary procedure, managing the legislative business of the Senate, and moderating floor debate. The President also acts as the Speaker Pro Tempore of Parliament, responsible for conducting the election of the Speaker of Parliament. The President also acts as the head of state, commissioning officers and ambassadors of the government and receiving ambassadors and representatives of foriegn governments.

> The President of the Senate shall impartially enforce the Senate's rules of procedure.

From time to time, the people may lose confidence in the policy preferences of Parliament in the middle of its term. Rather than suffer under an unresponsive government until the expiration of its term, the people should have the opportunity to replace their representatives. It is the duty of the Senate to recognize such a state of affairs, and disolve Parliament and call new elections when the need arises. A newly elected Parliament should have the opportunity to prove itself, and the expense and distruption of elections means we should avoid special elections too near to regularly scheduled general elections, so this power should be confined to the second and third years of a Parliamentary term.

> At any time more than one year after the current Parliament has taken office, and with more than one year remaining in its term, if the President judges that the people have lost confidence in Parliament, he or she may ask that the Senate disolve Parliament, which it shall do with a vote of three fifths of its membership.

At any time, the Vice President may offer a motion to depose the President. If such a motion carries, the Vice President shall become the President for the remainder of the current President's term. If the motion fails, the Vice President is deposed. In either case, the Senate shall then elect a new Vice President.

## Vacancies

During the course of an eight year term, some members are likely to depart the Senate, due to death, incapacity or expulsion. Such vacancies shall remain for the duration of the term to which the departed member was selected.

> In the event that a Senator is unable to complete his or her term of office, his or her seat shall remain vacant for the duration of the term to which he or she was appointed.

At times, the Senate may need to expel members for offenses ranging from criminal behavior, ethical failures, chronic absense, or incompetence.

> Upon the recommendation of the President, a Senator may be expelled by a two thirds vote of the Senate. An expelled Senator may be criminally prosecuted for the conduct compelling the expulsion.

## Compensation

Serving in the Senate should not come as a financial hardship, nor should Senators become so financially comfortable that they lose touch with the financial concerns of their lives prior to becoming Senators. So senators should be paid similarly to what they were paid prior to becoming Senators, though with a reasonable increase to accomodate the imposition, with a minimum floor and a maximum ceiling.

> Each Senator shall be paid an annual salary equivalent to five fourths of the maximum annual earnings of the Senator in the three years prior to selection as a Senator, with an annual real increase of five percent, but no less than 4,000 times the statutory minimum hourly wage, nor greater than 40,000 times the statutory minumum hourly wage. 
>
> No Senator shall accept any other emolument during his or her term of service, and any assets under the control of the Senator or his or her immediate family shall be managed by a trustee appointed by the Senate for the duration of his or her term in office.

Travel to the Capital for Senators and their immediate families should be provided, as should lodging in the Capital when Senators are required to be physically present. We live in a time when people can work remotely, and the Senate should primarily function via remote work, to ensure that Senators remain close to their communities. However, there are occasions where the full Senate should assemble in the Capital, and Senators should have frequent opportunities to spend time with each other in person.

> Parliament shall provide transportaion and lodging for Senators and their spouses and minor children when their presence is required in the Capital for official Senate business.
> 
> The whole Senate shall assemble in the Capital on the first day of its term to elect a President and Vice President, and to adopt its procedural rules. Senators may conduct all other business via telecommunication services established by Parliament, but the President may, from time to time, compel their presence in the Capital.

As service in the Senate is compulsory, a Senator may not simply resign or be fired for absenteeism. But Senators should be allowed time off for vacation, illness or to care for a loved one, so they should be guaranteed the same benefits and work protections that other workers enjoy under law.

> Senators shall be present when called to the Capital, and shall attend to the business of the Senate for the full duration of their terms, unless expelled by a vote of two thirds of the Senate, or excused from service at their own request with the concurrence of a majority of the Senate.
> 
> Senators shall be granted temporary absence from their duties under the same requirements of private employers, namely for vacation, illness, or to care for a family member, as established by this Constitution and by legislative statute.
