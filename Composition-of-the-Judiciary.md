The judiciary is primarily composed of local district courts and judges, who oversee civil and criminal trials. Similarly, administrative courts handle the sorts of legal business that don't require a jury to adjudicate the facts, but do require judicial oversight and approval.

Above the trial and administrative courts, sit courts of appeal.  As the name would suggest, these courts handle appeals oo the rulings of trial and administrative court judges, and jury verdicts. They may reverse (or uphold) applications of law by judges. In order to uphold the notion that a person should not face criminal prosecution for the same offense more than once, and the notion that it is better to let a thousand guilty people go free than to wrongly imprison a single innocent, the appeals court may only reverse findings of fact by juries when doing so would grant relief to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.

The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal. The Supreme Court may also review acts of Parliament for compliance with the requirements of this Constitution. The threshold for striking down acts of Parliament should be somewhat higher than for standard for regular judicial matters. In the event that the court nullifies an act of Parliament, Parliament must have the opportunity to overrule the court's decision.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The judicial power shall be vested in a Supreme Court, inferior Courts of Appeal, Trial Courts, and Administrative Law Courts.

> A judge's duty is to ensure justice. Laws, rules and procedures are meant as a guide as to the people's understanding of what justice entails.

## Courts with Original Jursidiction

Judicial matters should all originate in courts local to the parties to the matters at hand. We will create court districts, which should be of roughly the same population (though not so rigorously as legislative districts), and georgraphically compact enough to not impose hardship on those with matters before the court. And because of the relationship that courts have with the laws of provinces and counties, we should avoid court districts that don't respect those boundaries. So originating court districts should be confined to single provinces, and should only divide counties when those counties are too populous to be served by a single court district, in which case those districts should be confined to single counties.

> Parliament shall establish geographic districts for Trial and Administrative Law Courts. Such districts shall not cross Provincial boundaries, nor shall any County be divided between multiple Court districts unless such a district shall not contain any other County or portion thereof. No part of any Court district shall be more than one hundred kilometers from any courthouse in the district.

These courts should have a large enough number of judges to ensure that matters before them can be resolved in a timely fashion. Judges should be randomly assigned to any matter presented to the court, and therefore also need to have enough judges to prevent parties from manipulating outcomes of their cases by choosing a court where they are likely to draw a particular judge of their preference. However, should actual or perceived conflicts of interest exist, judges should recuse themselves, and whenever they fail to do so, the court itself should have the power to remove a judge from a case.

> Each Trial and Administrative Law Court districts shall be assigned no fewer than fifteen judges, and as manay more as Parliament shall individually deem necessary to ensure that the business of each Court may be resolved in a timely fashion. Matters brought before a Court shall be assigned to one of its judges via a randomized process defined by Parliament. Should a judge assigned to a case believe an actual or perceived conflict of interest exists and may call his or her impartiality into question at any point in the course of a case, he or she shall refer the case to the rest of the Court to be randomly reassigned. Any party to a case assigned to a particular judge may petition the full Court to have the case reassigned due to a sincere belief that the assigned judge cannot act impartially.
>
> Trial and Administrative Law Court judges shall be appointed by the Prime Minister, subject to the consent of the Senate, and may serve until ten years beyond the statutory retirment age, as defined by Parliament at the time of appointment. Trial and Administrative Law Court judges may be removed from office by two thirds of the Supreme Court, or upon impeachment by a majority of Parliament and concurrence of three fifths of the Senate, for malfeasance in office or willful misapplication of law.
>
> No person under thirty years of age shall be appointed as judge of a Trial or Administrative Law Court.
>
> No person previously convicted of a felony shall be appointed as judge of a Trial or Administrative Law Court.
>
> No Act of Parliament, nor precedent or tradition, shall purport to place any further qualifications upon the appointment of judges to Trial or Administrative Law Courts.

### Trial Courts

Trial courts are intended for criminal prosecutions and civil suits. In matters before a trial court, all parties are entitled to trial by an impartial jury of their peers. Judges on these courts are responsible for assembling juries and instructing them as to how the law should be applied, managing the evidence and testimony presented to the jury (as provided by law), imposing sentences on those found guilt of criminal offenses, and ensuring that the rights and obligations of all parties are upheld.

Additionaly, trial court judges are responsible for issuing arrest warrants, search warrants, subpoenas, and summonses. Judges may hold parties and witnesses in contempt of court for failure to abide by the court's authority, but any person held in contempt has the right to a speedy habeus process before another judge of the court.

Criminal prosecutions should be brought in the district where the crime allegedly occurred. Similarly, civil suits should be filed in the district where conduct at issue occurred. In our current digitally connected age, the question of where certain types of conduct occurred can be difficult to ascertain. This Constitution does not address this question, but instead leaves it to Parliament and the Courts themselves to work out.

> All criminal prosecutions shall originate and be tried in the Trial Court district in which the offense is alleged to have occurred.  Civil suits shall originate and be tried in the Trial Court district in which the conduct at issue is alleged to have occurred. Parliament may provide for how the location of certain conduct may be ascertained.
>
> All parties to a case before a Trial Court have a right to trial by an impartial jury of their peers. The judge shall be the trier of law, and the jury the trier of fact. A jury shall be composed of twelve members and three alternates. In any criminal proceding, a jury's finding of fact, including a verdict of guilt or innocence, must be unanimous, and beyond reasonable doubt. In any civil proceding, a jury's finding of fact must be supported by at least nine jurors and by a preponderance of the evidence.
>
> In criminal cases where a jury finds a defendant guilty, the trial judge shall impose a sentence of incarceration, fine, or both, in accordance with guidelines established by Parliament. In civil cases, only a jury my determine actual damages, but the trial judge may award punitive damages to the prevailing party not to exceed three times the actual damages; and may award the respondent attorney's fees, if the judge finds the plantiff's case to be without merit and intended to intimidate or harass the respondent.
>
> Warrants for arrest, search or seizure shall not be issued without the consent of a Trial Court judge in the district in which the arrest, search or seizure shall occur; nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
>
> No subpoena or summons to produce evidence or testimony shall be issued without the consent of the Trial Court judge overseeing the matter in which such evidence or testimony is required.

### Administrative Law Courts

Adjascent to trial courts are administrative law courts. These courts are responsible for judicial oversight of administrative matters like contracts, family law (including marriage, divorce and adoption), probate, competency and licensing.

> Administrative Law Courts shall have jurisdiction over matters in which no current dispute exists but where the rights and obligations of involved parties, including the government, require judicial oversight as provided by Parliament. Should a dispute arise in the course of a matter before an Administrative Law Court, any party to the matter may petition the Court to move the matter to a Trial Court proceeding.
> 
> Administrative law matters shall originate in the Administrative Law Court district in which in the initiating party claims his or her primary residence, or in which the initiatin party proposes to engage in covered conduct.

## Appeals Courts

Rulings from trial courts and administrative law courts are subject to appeal. As trial courts are engaged with the day to day business of trials, the burden of hearing appeals belongs to separate courts of appeal. 

> Parliament shall establish Courts of Appeal with jurisdiction to hear appeals from cases originating in such geographically contigous Trial and Adminstrative Law Courts as it shall deem appropriate, provided that appeals from all Trial and Administrative Law Courts within a single Province are heard by the same Court of Appeal.
> 
> A Court of Appeal shall be composed of fifteen judges. In all cases brought before a Court of Appeal, a panel of three judges randomly assigned by a method determined by Parliament shall hear all matters under appeal. Should the panel fail to reach a unanimous decision on any matter under appeal, the matter shall be reconsidered by an en banc hearing of the entire Court.
>
> A Court of Appeal may reverse or uphold any ruling of law, but shall only reverse a jury's finding of fact to grant relief to the accused in a criminal proceeding.
>
> Court of Appeal judges shall be appointed by the Prime Minister, subject to the consent of Parliament and the Senate, and may serve a term of no longer than twenty five years. Courts of Appeal judges may be removed from office by two thirds of the Supreme Court, or upon impeachment by a majority of Parliament and concurrence of three fifths of the Senate, for malfeasance in office or willful misapplication of law.
>
> No person not having served as a judge of a Trial or Administrative Law Court for at least five years hall be appointed as judge of a Court of Appeal.
>
> No person previously convicted of a felony shall be appointed as judge of a Court of Appeal.
>
> No Act of Parliament, nor precedent or tradition, shall purport to place any further qualifications upon the appointment of judges to Trial or Administrative Law Courts.

## The Supreme Court

The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal. Its primary purpose is judicial review of the law for conformance to Constitutional requirements. It also has final say over criminal convictions and sentences and penalties assessed in civil suits. With such immense power, it must be subject to some rigorous checks. Composed of 15 members with staggered 15 year terms (one judge's term expiring each year), over the course of two Parliamentary terms, the majority of the judges will be replaced, which gives the Parliament, and therefore the electorate, a strong hand in controlling any usurpations by the court.

> The Supreme Court shall be the court of final appeal. It shall be composed of fifteen mambers. It shall hear all appeals in cases of Treason, findings of Constitutional defect in Acts of Parliament, and any other case which any three of its judges agree to hear.
>
> Rulings establishing binding precedent shall be supported by three fifths of the members of the Supreme Court. Such precedents shall be binding upon inferior Courts, but no future Supreme Court shall be bound by an earlier Court's ruling.
>
> Supreme Court judges shall be appointed by the Prime Minister, subject to the consent of Parliament and three fifths of the Senate, and shall serve a term of fiteen years, with one judge's term expiring each year at midnight on the first day of October. Supreme Court judges may be removed from office upon impeachment by Parliament and concurrence of three fifths of the Senate, for malfeassance in office or willful misapplication of law.
>
> Should a judge be unable to complete his or her term in office due to death, incapacity, resignation or removal, the Prime Minister shall appoint a new judge, subject to the consent of Parliament and three fifths of the Senate, to serve out the remainder of the term. If, upon assuming office, less than five years remain in the term to which a judge is appointed, he or she may be appointed to serve an additional full term upon the expiration of the partial term to which he or she was originally appointed.

## Constitutional Review

The judiciary is also responsible for resolving conflicts in the law. These conflicts may arise where laws passed by Parliament or lower legislatures violate principles set forth by this Constitution; laws passed by lower legislatures may violate provisions of laws passed by Parliament; executive rule making may conflict with the intent of an act of Parliament, or one law passed by Parliament may conflict with another law also passed by Parliament.

In cases where laws passed by the same legislature conflict with one another, the more recently adopted law should be presumed to prevail. However, Parliament and lower legislatures should take care to clearly state that prior laws or provisions are being repealed.

In cases where the laws enacted by a province, county or municipality conflict with the laws of a higher legislative body, the laws of the higher body should take precedence, with acts of Parliament and this Constitution being the supreme law.

When an executive rule or regulation exceeds the authority delegated by Parliament, the court should defer to Parliament.

When an act of Parliament, or any lower legislature, or any executive regulation runs afoul of a provision of this Constitution, the courts may invalidate those laws or regulations. However, only the Supreme Court should be able to overturn acts of Parliament or its executive, and with a higher threshold than for other matters. Parliament should have the opportunity to overrule the court's judgment in such cases.

> A Trial Court may issue a finding that an Act of an inferior legislature or its executive violates the law or Constitution of a superior legislature. Such a finding shall have no force of law unless affirmed by the Court of Appeal with jurisdiction over the Trial Court, and not overruled by the Supreme Court.
>
> A Trial Court may issue a finding that a rule or regulation promulgated by an executive agency exceeds the authority delegated by Parliament. Such a finding shall not be sustained without the concurrence of Parliament.
>
> A Trial Court may issue a finding that one Act of Parliament supercedes a prior Act, and that the prior Act is no longer valid. Such a finding shall remain in effect unless overruled by the Court of Appeal with jurisdiction over the Trial Court or the Supreme Court. Parliament shall remain free to clarify any such conflict of law, but such clarification shall not be enforced ex post facto.
>
> A Trial Court may issue a finding that an Act of Parliament or any rule or regulation promulgated by an executive agency violates one or more provisions of this Constitution. Such a finding shall have no force in law unless affirmed by the Supreme Court. A finding of Constitutional defect with an Act of Parliament shall require the concurrence of three fifths of the members of the Supreme Court. Parliament may overrule such a finding with a vote of two thirds of its members within thirty days of such a finding, otherwise the entirety of the Act in question shall be nullified.
>
> All other cases may before the Supreme Court shall be decided by a majority of its members. Where no majority can be found, the ruling on appeal shall stand, without force of precedent.
