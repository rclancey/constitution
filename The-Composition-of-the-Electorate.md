For any government to be legitimate, it must be responsive to the needs of *all* of its subjects.  For a government to be responsive to all of its subjects, all of its subjects must have their views considered when making, enforcing and adjudicating the law.  This means that we should strive to include as much of the population as possible in the electorate, and should err on the side of inclusion, rather than exclusion.

For the purposes of defining the electorate, let us first examine who is subject to the force of the government.  In most countries, every person within the territorial borders of that country, except officially recognized diplomatic representatives of foreign governments, are subject to the laws of that country.  This includes citizens, immigrants and foreign visitors.  It includes adults and children.  It includes the law abiding and the law breaking.  It also includes those abroad at the direction of the government, such as diplomatic representatives and military service members.  It may also include citizens residing or traveling abroad.

Historically, the primary purpose of citizenship was to restrict the electorate.  Since our goal is for the electorate to be as expansive as possible, we will disregard this concept.  Instead, we will consider residency to be the primary factor determining eligibility to vote.

## Gender

> No person shall be denied the right to vote on the basis of gender, expressed or perceived gender identity, sexual orientation, or marital status.

## Race

> No person shall be denied the right to vote on the basis of racial or ethnic heritage, national origin, immigration status, or primary language.

## Age

Traditionally, children have not been granted the right to vote, and this right has been reserved for adults, often at the age of 18. We find this limitation arbitrary and harmful to the interests of children, who have as much at stake in governmental affairs as anyone.

While we do not suggest that children of any age are capable of responsibly exercising their right to vote, we do believe that by the age of 12, children should have the independent right to cast a ballot without parental review. For those under 12, we believe that their parents or guardians have the responsibility to exercise their children's rights on their behalf in other contexts, and voting should be no different.

Therefore:

> No person shall be denied the right to vote on the basis of age. A parent or guardian may cast a ballot on behalf of a child under the age of 12 in their care.

## Criminal sanctions

Those convicted of criminal offenses bear the fullest weight of government, and should never be stripped of the right to vote. However, those who actively seek to undermine the democratic process itself (an act of treason, described elsewhere in this document) should not be entrusted with its power.

Therefore:

> No person shall be denied the right to vote on the basis of criminal conviction or incarceration, except in cases of treason.

## Competence

There are people who are, through age related mental deterioration or psychiatric disorders, unable to make sound judgements about their own well being, and may be deemed incompetent. As voting is an important exercise in judgement about one's own well being, a person deemed incompetent may not be capable of voting. However, we must take extreme precautions against the abuse of such competence determinations. A person may only be determined ineligible to vote by reason of incompetence if a three judge court panel unanimously agrees that the person is not fit to live independently, manage his or her own financial affairs, and does not have a clear understanding of objective reality. Anyone facing a judgement of incompetence must be afforded the opportunity to challenge any evidence supporting their incapacity before the court, with the assistence of counsel. Any such determination is subject to appeal, and may not be in force for a period longer than five years.

Therefore:

> No person shall be denied the right to vote on the basis of mental capacity, unless proven to a unanimous three judge court, that said person is unfit to live independently, unfit to manage his or her own financial affairs, and to be incapable of recognizing objective reality.
> Any person subjected to the question of mental capacity shall have the right to challenge any claims of incompetence against them before the court, with the assistance of counsel.
> No such judgement shall extend to a period of more than five years without review.

## Residency

Each person is entitled to vote in the elections for any jurisdiction whose territorial boundary encompasses the person's primary residence. For most people, defining their primary residence is a simple matter: it is their home.  However, there are a number of different cases where such a definition falls short.

### People with multiple homes

A person with multiple homes should not be permitted to vote multiple times. But how should we determine which home represents a person's *primary* residence? We should consider multiple factors: Where does the person sleep most often? Where has the person lived the longest? Where has the person lived most recently? Where does the person himself or herself consider "home". The answer to these questions may not all point to the same home. So let us make this arrangement: for the purposes of electoral representation, a person may claim one place as a primary residence, provided that the person has slept in the residence on at least 20 separate occasions in the 90 days prior to an election, and has not voted in another jurisdiction in the preceding year.

The residence claimed as a person's primary residence for the purposes of electoral representation must also be treated as the person's primary residence for all other governmental purposes, including taxation and the census.

### People with no home

While we strive to ensure that every person has a place to call home, there remain those who, by choice or by institutional failure, live without the benefit of a permanent home. These people are no less entitled to vote than those who do have a permanent home. So where should they vote? For electoral purposes, we should consider their living situation not terribly differently than those with multiple homes. Where a person sleeps most often is where he or she resides, regardless of whether or not that place has a roof and four walls.

### Those confined against their will

Inmates incarcerated in prison for committing criminal offenses, and people civilly committed to psychiatric institutions for being a danger to themselves or others are still subject to the laws of the country, and are therefore eligible to vote. However, it is not necessarily appropriate to consider the place of their confinement to represent their *residence*. A person involuntarily confined may identify their primary residence prior to their confinement as their current primary residence, or they may choose the place of their confinement.

### Those living abroad

Since we consider residency as the most important factor in determining eligibility to vote, those voluntarily residing abroad are not eligible to vote until once again establishing a domestic residence. However, there are those, like deployed military personnel and diplomatic representatives, who are living abroad at the direction of the government.  In those cases, for electoral purposes, a person may claim as their residence their primary residence prior to their foreign deployment.

Therefore:

> No person shall be denied the right to vote within the jurisdiction that encompasses his or her primary residence, provided that he or she has not voted in another jurisdiction in the preceding 12 months, including a foreign nation. A person's primary residence is the place where he or she has resided (or slept) most often in the previous 90 days, or such a place prior to incarceration or foreign diplomatic or military deployment.
