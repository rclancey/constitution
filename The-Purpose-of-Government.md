The United States Declaration of Independence provides one of the most concise statements of the purpose of government: that governments are instituted among the people to secure the basic human rights of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," and that such governments derive their powers "from the consent of the governed."

A government must be able to operate on the basis of majority rule, but it still must respect the rights and interests of *all* of its subjects, including those in the minority of popular opinion. This is the great question at the heart of designing a just and equitable government.
