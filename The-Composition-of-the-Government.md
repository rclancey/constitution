The experience of the governing structures of the United States has shown that the separation of legislative power from executive power leads to executive supremacy rather than the legislative supremacy the Constitution's authors envisioned. In order for the legislature to exercise its supremacy over the executive, executive functions must be carried out under the authority of the legislature.

However, the notion of checks and balances within governing structures has value in curbing the excesses of absolute authority. So we invest the legislative power in a Parliament, which is responsible for drafting, enacting and carrying out the law. In a Senate, we invest the power to veto acts of Parliament. And finally, we invest in a Supreme Court the power to invalidate acts of Parliament that run afoul of provisions of this constitution, to settle disputes between conflicting provisions in the law, and to protect the rights of the people from the privations of authoritarian government.

> The government shall consist of three bodies, the [Parliament](./Composition-of-Parliament.md), the [Senate](./Composition-of-the-Senate.md), and the [Supreme Court](./Composition-of-the-Judiciary.md).

## Parliament

Single member districts drawn by politicians do not promote equal representation in the legislature. They encourage politicians to draw districts in such a way as to solidify their hold on power without regard to majoritarian support. Political parties have evolved as a means for people to organize around shared values and agendas, and we should embrace this aspect of parties. Geographical concerns remain relevant to communities, and so we should also strive to give voice to those local concerns that are separate from partisan opinion.

Several countries have established representative bodies that embrace both partisan and geographic representation via a system known as [Mixed Member Proportional Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation) in which a portion of a body's members are elected to represent traditional geographical single-member districts, and the rest are chosen by allocating a number of seats to each party, based on the proportion of votes received by that party, and each party chooses members to fill those seats.

> Parliament shall consist of elected representatives in a mixed member proportional system. The number of members elected to represent geographic districts shall be equal to the number of representatives elected by party list.
> 
> No person elected to represent a district may also fill a party list seat.

### Districts

Districts should be as compact as possible, while respecting the geography of existing communities. To respect the principle of one person, one vote, districts should have an equally sized populations (or as close to equal as practical), and districts should be small enough that their representatives can adequately represent the diversity of their constituents, yet not so numerous as to make their assembly impractical.

> Parliament itself shall be responsible for determining the number of districts and their boundaries, following each census, but no district shall have fewer than one hundred thousand residents and not more than two hundred and fifty thousand residents as of the most recent census.
> 
> District boundaries must be continuous and contiguous. District boundaries should be compact and respect existing community boundaries, where possible. However, the ratio of the population of the largest district to the population of the smallest district may be no larger than 1.05

### Parties

Parties organize around not just policy preferences, but also around policy priorities. So while two parties may share the same positions on different issues, they may differ on the relative importance of acting on those positions, especially when the art of legislating often means compromise and deal making. These differences can lead to a proliferation of small parties, which, while making representation of the true spectrum of partisan preference possible, also makes governance through coalition building unstable. So we should limit the number of parties in government to a sensible size that balances these needs.

Therefore:

> Any party which receives at least three percent of the national vote is entitled to at least one seat in Parliament. Any party which receives less than three percent of the national vote and does not win any district election is not entitled to any party list seats.

While parties generally represent a collection of people with shared political philosophies and policy positions, the reality is that rarely do individuals agree with every policy choice of any any party, including the leaders of those parties. So when it comes time to choose partisan representation in Parliament, we are actually choosing individuals who may at times diverge in their opinions from the party platform, and so those particular individuals must be named if voters are to discern what a vote for a given party will actually mean in terms of how their vote reflects their policy preferences.

Therefore:

> 30 days prior to an election, each party qualified for the ballot must publish the list of members, in order, that it will appoint to Parliament based on its allocation of seats.

With an integral number of seats, and no fractional representation, we must devise a method for dividing party list seats in a manner such that the integral number of seats allocated to each party is a as close as possible to the share of the vote that each party receives. We find that the [method of equal proportions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%E2%80%93Hill_method) arrives at the fairest allocation of seats.

> Party seats shall be allocated using the method of equal proportions. Initially, each party will be allocated the number of seats won in district elections. Then any party with no district-based seats that received at least three percent of the party vote shall be allocated one seat. The remaining seats shall be allocated one at a time to the party with the highest priority, with priority defined as the ratio of the number of votes the party received to the geometric mean of of the number of seats the party is currently assigned and the number of seats the party would be assigned if the next seat were allocated to the party. Mathematically, this can be expressed as
> 
> <math>
    <mrow>
        <mi>P</mi>
        <mo>=</mo>
        <mfrac>
            <mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow>
            <mrow>
                <msqrt>
                    <mi>n</mi>
                    <mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo>
                </msqrt>
            </mrow>
        </mfrac>
    </mrow>
</math>
> 
> Where <math><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow></math> is the party's priority, <math><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow></math> is the number of votes received by the party, and <math><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> is the number of seats currently allocated to the party.

Parties are always evolving, and we should strive to ensure that as the preferences of the electorate evolve, the ability of new parties to access the ballot should not impede their formation. On the other hand, we should strive to preserve some stability in our parties, such that voters can be confident in their choices. So parties that are currently represented in the Parliament should always have access to the ballot, and new parties should have a means of gaining ballot access when they have demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of winning seats in Parliament when granted ballot access.

Therefore:

> Any party currently represented in Parliament is automatically qualified for the ballot. A party may also qualify for the ballot by submitting petitions signed by one half of one percent of the number of votes cast in the prior election, or upon the sponsorship of five members of the Senate.

### Term

In order to most faithfully represent the evolving opinions of the electorate, the term of Parliament should not be too long. Nor should its term be so short as to cause instability or prevent the government from enacting its agenda. Four year terms give the government an adequate amount of time to settle in, enact an agenda and demonstrate the success (or failure) of its policies.

Therefore:

> The term of Parliament shall end at noon (in the local time zone of the capital) on the first day of years divisible by four. Elections for members of Parliament shall conclude 30 days prior to the expiration of the term of the current Parliament, at which time, Parliament shall be dissolved.

However, there are times when the actions of the government cause the electorate to lose confidence in the government well before the expiration of its term.  So there needs to be a safety valve that allows the electorate to urgently replace a defiant or corrupt government. We grant the Senate the authority to dissolve Parliament and call early elections in such an emergency.

> The Senate, with the consent of three fifths of its membership, may dissolve Parliament and call early elections to fill the remainder of the current Parliament's term, provided there remain at least 180 days in the term of the current Parliament. In this case, an election must be concluded within forty five days of the Senate dissolving Parliament, and newly elected members shall take office at noon, fifteen days following the conclusion of the election.

From time to time, there arise disputes as to the vote counts or proper winner of an election. As the Parliament has a conflict of interest in adjudicating these disputes, the power to settle such disputes should be left to an independent body. And as the judiciary can potentially be captured by partisan actors, this role must be left to the Senate to ensure free and fair elections.

Therefore:

> The Senate shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of the members of Parliament.

### Qualifications

In order to be effective as legislators, we expect a certain degree of experience and understanding of policy for members of Parliament.

> No person may serve in Parliament who has not reached the age of 25 years.

> No person may serve in Parliament who has been convicted of a felony.

> No person may serve in Parliament while simultaneously serving in the armed forces.

### Organization

The first order of business for a newly seated Parliament is to choose the government. The Prime Minister is the head of government, and shall be chosen by the members of Parliament via instant runoff voting. The Leader of the
Opposition shall be chosen with the same votes, but with those ultimately cast for the Prime Minister discarded.

### Legislative Committees

The legislative business of the Parliament shall be allocated among several committees. A committee may be established by an act of Parliament, which may also define the policy purview of the committee. A legislative committee may also be dissolved by an act of Parliament, which may also transfer its purview to other legislative committees.

The Prime Minister shall select fifteen members of each legislative committee, and the Leader of the Opposition shall select twelve members of each legislative committee. Each committee shall elect its own chair, who must receive a majority of votes.

Legislative committees may divide their work amongst up to five subcommittees. The committee may establish such subcommittees without a formal act of Parliament. Subcommittees may have no more than nine members. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition shall each appoint half of the members of a subcommittee from amongst the committee's members, and the chair of the committee shall appoint the chair of the subcommittee from amongst the committee's members.

Any member of Parliament may propose a bill. The Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition may refer such a bill to one or more committees with purview over the topic of the bill. The committee may then amend the bill and report it back to the whole Parliament with any further proposed amendments. Any bill reported back to the whole Parliament by every committee to which it was referred shall be considered by the whole Parliament within ten legislative days.

### Executive Departments

The executive business of Parliament shall be performed by executive departments. An executive department may be established by an act of Parliament. The executive officers of the executive departments form the cabinet.

The Prime Minister shall nominate an executive officer and two deputies for each executive department, and the Leader of the Opposition shall nominate a shadow officer and one deputy for each executive departments. Such nominations must be confirmed by a majority of the full membership of Parliament.

# The Senate

The Senate shall consist of one thousand members, randomly chosen from amongst the population of eligible voters. One fourth of their number shall be chosen and seated in each even numbered year, for a term of eight years.

## Selection

Parliament shall devise a method for randomly selecting candidates for the Senate.

For each class of Senators, two thousand randomly chosen candidates shall be summoned to the Capitol on the first day of May in even numbered years. The presiding judge of the Supreme Court shall oversee the selection of Senators.  The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament shall each have the option of dismissing up to two hundred of the candidates for any reason whatsoever. The remaining candidates may petition the presiding judge to be released from service on the grounds of ineligibility, incapacity, or insurmountable obstacles. Any remaining candidate may be dismissed with the unanimous agreement of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the presiding judge of the Supreme Court. The two hundred and fifty remaining candidates with the lowest randomly assigned priority shall be chosen as Senators.

## Term

> The term of a Senator shall begin at noon on the first day of July in an even numbered year and expire eight years thereafter.

## Qualifications

> No person may serve in the Senate who has not reached the age of 18 years.

> No person may serve in the Senate who currently holds public elective or judicial office.

> No person may serve in the Senate while simultaneously incarcerated in prison for a felony.

> No person may serve in the Senate while simultaneously serving in the armed forces.

## Organization

The President of the Senate is the head of state.  On the fifteenth day of August of even numbered years, the Senate shall choose from amongst its members a President and Vice President independently via instant runoff voting. The term of the President and Vice President shall commence at noon on the first day of October in odd numbered years and expire two years thereafter. Any member of the Senate may serve as President or Vice President so long as he or she remains a member of the Senate.

At any time, the Vice President may offer a motion to depose the President. If such a motion carries, the Vice President shall become the President for the remainder of the current President's term.  If the motion fails, the Vice President is deposed. In either case, the Senate shall then elect a new Vice President.



The first order of business for a newly seated Parliament is to choose the government. The Prime Minister is the head of government, and shall be chosen by the members of Parliament via instant runoff voting. The Leader of the Opposition shall be chosen with the same votes, but with those ultimately cast for the Prime Minister discarded.

Legislative power is vested solely in the Parliament. While Parliament may delegate to executive agencies the power to promulgate the technical rules and minutae necessary to carry out Parliament's legislative vision, Parliament, and Parliament alone is responsible for drafting and enacting public policy.

Parliament may enact legislation with a majority of its membership in favor. However, should two thirds of the membership of the Senate disapprove, the bill shall be returned to Parliament for reconsideration. If Parliament again passes the bill with at least two thirds of its membership in favor, the bill shall become law. If a majority of the Senate disapproves of a bill,

Executive power is similarly vested in Parliament. However, Parliament may delegate, as it sees fit, some or all of its executive authority to executive ministers such as the prime minister or various cabinet ministers, or to
independent bodies. In all such cases, this delegation of executive authority must be made via legislation, and Parliament shall always retain the power to rescind or modify such delegations of its executive power through passage of overriding legislation.
