The unfettered accumulation and concentration of wealth presents a direct threat to democratic governance. Therefore, Parliament shall have the power to tax wealth. Such wealth taxes shall be progressive, meaning that those with more wealth are taxed at higher rates than those with less, where only the difference between two taxation levels is taxed at the higher rate. Such tax rates may reach 100%, but no higher. Parliament shall determine which classes of assets and liabilities comprise a person's wealth, including unrealized capital gains, illiquid assets, and what arrangements constitute control of an asset.

Access to clean, safe drinking water is a human right.

Aceess to healthy food is a human right.

Access to safe, clean, climate controlled shelter is a human right.

Access to quality education is a human right.

Access to quality medical care is a human right.

Bodily autonomy is a human right.

Freedom from violence is a human right.

Freedom from surveilance is a human right.

Freedom of conscience is a human right.

Freedom of expression without deception is a human right.

Freedom of association is a human right.

Self determination is a human right.

Safe conditions and equitible pay for honest labor are human rights.

Governments exercise control over soveriegn territory. Any territory whose residents seek independence should have it granted, with the following conditions: 1) the majority of residents must affirmatively support independence (meaning a majority of the population, not simply a majority of votes cast); 2) those opposed are provided the opportunity to leave the independent territory prior to it gaining its independence; 3) the departing territory assumes a per-capita portion of the nation's debts; 4) all property of the national government within the independent territory, other than land and permanent structures, is returned to the national government. The residents of the independent territory forfeit the rights, privileges and protections of the national government, and may be declared persona non grata by an act of Parliament.
