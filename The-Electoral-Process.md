## Parties

Parties should be organized with a publicly available charter that describes:

* The animating values of the party
* The criteria for party membership[^1]
* The leadership structure and processes for electing leaders
* The processes for nominating candidates for single winner offices
* The processes for placing candidates on legislative party lists
* The processes for composing a platform of policy preferences
* The processes for amending the party's charter

[^1]: Party membership should be open to all eligible voters, though parties may impose membership fees to support their operations. They may also impose criteria, such as educational, professional or geographic requirements, but may not discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or other protected characteristics.

Parties organize around not just policy preferences, but also around policy priorities. So while two parties may share the same positions on different issues, they may differ on the relative importance of acting on those positions, especially when the art of legislating often means compromise and deal making. These differences can lead to a proliferation of small parties, which, while making representation of the true spectrum of partisan preference possible, also makes governance through coalition building unstable. So we should limit the number of parties in government to a sensible size that balances these needs.

But since parties are always evolving, we should strive to ensure that as the preferences of the electorate evolve, the ability of new parties to access the ballot should not impede their formation. On the other hand, we should also strive to preserve some stability in our parties, such that voters can be confident in their choices. So parties that are currently represented in the legislature should always have access to the ballot, and new parties should have a means of gaining ballot access when they have demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of winning seats in Parliament when granted ballot access.

> Any party represented in the legislature of a jurisdiction (at the time of the prior election) shall qualify to nominate candidates for all elected offices within that jurisdiction.
> 
> A party not currently represented in the legislature may also qualify for the ballot by submitting petitions signed by one half of one percent of the number of votes cast in the prior election for that legislature, or upon the sponsorship of five members of the Senate.

## Single Winner Offices

Offices for which a single winner is chosen shall be chosen via a ranked choice election meant to select the candidate with the support of a majority of the vote, rather than a simple plurality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _**Single winner offices shall be elected via ranked choice voting.**_

> The method of conducting a ranked choice election shall be as follows:
> 
> 1. Parties shall nominate a candidate for the given office.
> 1. Voters shall rank each candidate according to their preference, though they are not required to rank all candidates.
> 1. Votes shall be counted in multiple rounds. In each round of counting:
>     1. Any ballot that does not rank the remaining candidates is discarded, and not considered for the purpose of constituting a majority.
>     1. If any remaining candidate is preferred over every other remaining candidate in a head-to-head matchup, that candidate is the winner.
>     1. If any remaining candidate is the top choice of a majority of the votes, that candidate is the winner.
>     1. If any remaining candidate loses to every other remaining candidate, that candidate is eliminated from consideration, and the process repeats.
>     1. The remaining candidate who is the top choice of the fewest number of votes is eliminated from consideration, and the process repeats.

## Legislative Bodies

Legislative bodies at all levels of government consist of elected representatives.

Single member districts drawn by politicians do not promote equal representation in the legislature. They encourage politicians to draw districts in such a way as to solidify their hold on power without regard to majoritarian support. Political parties have evolved as a means for people to organize around shared values and agendas, and we should embrace this aspect of parties. Geographical concerns remain relevant to communities, and so we should also strive to give voice to those local concerns that are separate from partisan opinion.

Several countries have established representative bodies that embrace both partisan and geographic representation via a system known as [Mixed Member Proportional Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation) in which a portion of a body's members are elected to represent traditional geographical single-member districts, and the rest are chosen by allocating a number of seats to each party, based on the proportion of votes received by that party, and each party chooses members to fill those seats.

Therefore:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _**Legislative bodies shall consist of elected representatives in a mixed member proportional system. The number of members elected to represent geographic districts shall be equal to the number of representatives elected by party list.**_
> 
> _**Elections for the legislature shall present each voter with two questions:**_
> 1. _**A ranked choice vote for a district representative**_
> 1. _**A single choice of party preference**_
> 
> _**No person elected to represent a district may also fill a party list seat.**_

### Districts

Districts should be as compact as possible, while respecting the geography of existing communities. To respect the principle of one person, one vote, districts should have an equally sized populations (or as close to equal as practical). And districts should be small enough that their representatives can adequately represent the diversity of their constituents, yet not so numerous as to make their assembly impractical.

Districts elect a single member using the same ranked choice method used to elect single member offices.

> A legislative body shall be responsible for determining the number of its districts and their boundaries, subject to conditions set forth elsewhere in this document.
> 
> District boundaries must be continuous and contiguous. District boundaries should be compact and respect existing community boundaries, where possible. However, the ratio of the population of the largest district to the population of the smallest district may be no larger than 1.05.
> 
> District representatives shall be elected via the same ranked choice voting method used to elect single winner offices.

### Party Lists

While parties generally represent a collection of people with shared political philosophies and policy positions, the reality is that rarely do individuals agree with every policy choice of any any party, including the leaders of those parties. So when it comes time to choose partisan representation in Parliament, we are actually choosing individuals who may at times diverge in their opinions from the party platform, and so those particular individuals must be named if voters are to discern what a vote for a given party will actually mean in terms of how their vote reflects their policy preferences.

> 30 days prior to an election, each party qualified for the ballot must publish the list of members, in order, that it will appoint to Parliament based on its allocation of seats.

As previously stated, the number of parties in the legislature should be limited in order to allow for stable governing coalitions. The ways in which this number is determined should be at the discretion of the legislative body itself, subject to some reasonable limits.

> A legislative body may set the following qualifications for parties to recieve list seats:
> 1. The number of parties recieving list seats may be directly capped at some number of the most popular parties, but this number may be no less than six.
> 1. The minimum vote share necessary for a party to receive list seats may be set to a value no lower than ten percent.
> 1. If the parties that qualify based on the thresholds set forth by the legislature constitute less than eighty percent of the total vote, additional parties, in order of vote share, shall receive list seats until eighty percent of the votes are represented.

With an integral number of seats, and no fractional representation, we must devise a method for dividing party list seats in a manner such that the integral number of seats allocated to each party is a as close as possible to the share of the vote that each party receives. We find that the [method of equal proportions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%E2%80%93Hill_method) arrives at the fairest allocation of seats.

> Party seats shall be allocated using the method of equal proportions. Initially, each party will be allocated the number of seats won in district elections. Then any party with no district-based seats that qualified for list seats shall be allocated one seat. The remaining seats shall be allocated one at a time to the party with the highest priority, with priority defined as the ratio of the number of votes the party received to the geometric mean of of the number of seats the party is currently assigned and the number of seats the party would be assigned if the next seat were allocated to the party. Mathematically, this can be expressed as
